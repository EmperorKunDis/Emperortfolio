                    In the following section is a list of all my projects that 
                    have survived until today. Unfortunately for technical reasons I lost a 
                    lot of data mostly from the period when I was learning. At the same time 
                    I would like to point out that everything I have learned in the last two 
                    years I have learned on my own. I had no guidance and no help or anyone to 
                    advise me on how git works or what program to use to make an assembly. I 
                    studied everything in the time after my standard job where I program the 
                    backend in a different programming language than the one I develop in.
