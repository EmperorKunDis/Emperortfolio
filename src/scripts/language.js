    aboutHidden: `In 2012, I returned from Prague to Cheb. Finding a job in my field in Cheb was impossible. Many of my successful classmates were working for 
    low wages at O2 or T-Mobile or in manual labor in printing shops. The only viable option to improve my living standards was to work in Germany.
In 2012, I began working for a German company. Despite my comprehensive education, including over 13 years of English studies (with a focus on IT and business 
English), I had to start at the lowest level. It took me nearly three years to progress from being a helper to installing sockets.Thanks to my logical thinking 
and experience with technical drawing, I quickly became proficient with technical documentation and assembly plans. After three years, I led several small teams 
of electricians, traveling across Germany to build houses and install office interiors. It was a fulfilling job with good pay, and I was content as a single man.
However, the COVID-19 pandemic changed everything. It made travel for installations more difficult, and I started a family. Traveling for work was no longer an 
option, so I sought work closer to the border. For six months, I worked in a glass factory, sweeping floors. It was one of the most challenging periods of my 
life. Eventually, I decided to fully pursue my passion for programming and software development. Times have changed, and today, it is possible to find good jobs 
in software development even in border regions, including game development, which has always been my passion. Since high school, I have been programming my own 
solutions. I maintain a homelab with Linux servers for various purposes, such as a shared hard disk, media server, and personal cloud for backing up photos from 
my mobile devices. I have also programmed custom reprogrammable buttons for any peripheral (mouse, keyboard, etc.). Solving basic problems through programming my 
own solutions has always been my approach.

🔧 Tech-Savvy Innovator: With a passion for technology and innovation, I have transformed my home into a fully functional 
homelab, featuring Linux servers that power a variety of personal projects and utilities. From a shared hard disk to a robust media server, my setup is designed 
to optimize convenience and enhance digital experiences.☁️ Personal Cloud Architect: In today's digital age, having secure access to your data is crucial. 
That's why I've built my own personal cloud for seamless photo uploads from mobile devices. With my custom solutions, I ensure that all your precious memories 
are stored safely and can be accessed anytime, anywhere. 🎛️ Custom Peripheral Programming: Efficiency and personalization are key to productivity. I specialize 
in programming reprogrammable buttons on peripherals such as mice and keyboards. Whether it's for gaming, work, or creative projects, I can tailor your devices 
to fit your unique needs, enhancing your workflow and overall experience. 💡 Problem-Solving Pro: Encountering a tech issue? I thrive on solving basic problems 
by programming my own solutions. With a strong foundation in coding and problem-solving skills, I can develop and implement custom software to tackle everyday 
challenges, making life simpler and more efficient. I built 3 drones, participated in several flying days at the Cheb airport, and completed numerous courses 
in game development, primarily in Unreal Engine but also in other areas. I learned programming in several languages, including C++, C#, Java, and JavaScript.
Now, I believe the time is right to fully dive into the software development industry and contribute to its progress. I am a father, husband, gamer, Star Wars 
fan, programmer, and a technically minded atheist who believes that with hard work and dedication, any kind of success is possible.

    aboutHidden: `Profesionální cesta softwarového vývojáře: Od zednictví k hernímu designu

    V roce 2012 jsem se vrátil z Prahy do Chebu. Po ukončení vysokoškolského studia jsem se pokusil 
    prosadit jako softwarový vývojář v Praze. Bohužel jsem neuspěl, protože moji rodiče neměli žádné 
    kontakty v Praze ani finanční zázemí, které by mi pomohlo se v hlavním městě usadit. Najít práci 
    v mém oboru v Chebu se ukázalo jako nemožné. Všichni moji uspesni spolužáci pracovali za nízké 
    mzdy v 02 nebo T-Mobile nebo dělali manuální práci v tiskárnách. Jediný způsob, jak se trochu 
    lepe uživit, se ukázala být práce v Německu. V roce 2012 jsem začal pracovat pro německou 
    společnost. Navzdory svému vzdělání (základní, střední, střední a vysoké škole) a studiu 
    angličtiny celkem více než 13 let (včetně 2 let IT angličtiny a 1,5 roku ekonomické angličtiny) 
    jsem musel začítzačínat na nejnižší pozici. Trvalo mi skoro 3 roky, než jsem se z pomocníka se 
    zbíječkou vypracoval k montáži zásuvek. 
    
    Díky svému logickému myšlení a zkušenostem s technickým kreslením jsem se rychle zorientoval v 
    technické dokumentaci a montážních plánech. Po třech letech jsem se stal vedoucím několika malých 
    týmů elektrikářů a jezdili jsme po celém Německu, stavěli rodinné domy a instalovali kancelářské 
    interiéry. Byla to dobrá práce s dobrým platem a jako svobodný jsem byl šťastný. Nebýt pandemie 
    covid-19, pravděpodobně bych v té práci byl dodnes. Pandemie covid-19 však pro mě všechno změnila. 
    Zkomplikovalo to cestování za Montazemi. Zároveň jsem si našel manželku, založili jsme rodinu a 
    cestování na týdenní bazi či delší pracovní montaze už pro mě nebyly možné. Musel jsem si najít 
    práci blízko hranic. Půl roku jsem pracoval ve sklárně, zametal podlahu. Bylo to jedno z nejhorších 
    období mého života. Tehdy jsem se však konečně rozhodl věnovat svému koníčku, vývoji her a 
    programování naplno a začal jsem velmi aktivně studovat a hledat cesty, jak dosáhnout svého snu. 
    Doba se změnila a dnes je možné najít dobrou práci v oblasti vývoje softwaru i v příhraničních 
    regionech, a to i v oblasti vývoje her, ktere byly vzdy mou vasni. 
    
    Když 9. prosince 2021 vyšlo hratelné demo UE5 Matrix, byl jsem nadšen. Netušil jsem, že se herní 
    průmysl posunul tak daleko vždy jsem myslel že bez stovek lidi a stovek pocitacu neni vývoj her 
    mozny.Věděl jsem, že si to musím doma stáhnout.A tak jsem taky udelal stáhl jsem si UE5 a první 
    víkend na něm strávil přes 30 hodin, našel UnrealSensei na YouTube a první víkend udělal dva 
    tutoriály. A bylo to úžasné a během následujících pár měsíců jsem nad tím strávil asi 40-50 hodin 
    týdně. A dostal jsem se do situace, kdy mohu vše přidat a vše nastavit, ale nemá to žádnou funkci 
    a není to hra, jen svět, kterým se můžete volně pohybovat. A právě když jsem si myslel, že budu 
    muset hledat zdroj, který by mě naučil vyvíjet hry v UE jak skutecne vyvijet ne jen tvořit hriste 
    kde si neni mozne hrat, objevil jsem na HumbleBundle promo akci na „Create Unreal 5 Engine Games 
    Bundle“ a koupil jsem si kompletní balíček s všechny kurzy tim zapocalo videoherni dobrodruzstvi. 
    Nasledni v nadcházejících měsících a letech jsem se podilel parkrat na nejakych projektech na Game 
    Jamu, napsal nekolik webovych stranek, udelal nekolik assetu,vyrobil par konceptu her prestehoval 
    jsem se z ceske republiky do nemecka ( protoze nechci aby se mym detem stalo to co me ze se roky 
    neco ucim a pak to neni kde vyuzit ), narodila se mi druha dcera, konecne sem hral na oficialnim 
    serveru WoW vyexpil mage na high level a s jako soucast guildy Bohemian Lions se “zapsal do dejin”
    , postavil 3 drony a podilel se na nekolika leteckych dnech na letisti v Chebu, udelal neskutecne 
    mnozstvi ruznych kurzu kolem vývoje her vetsinou v Unreal Engine ale ne jen v nem, naucil sem se 
    programovat v nekolik programovacich jazycich (C++, C#, Java, JavaScript{HTML a CSS nepovazuji za 
    programovaci jazyky}). A ted myslim ze konecne dozral cas a muj skill abych se naplno vrhl do 
    vysneneho prumyslu a pomohl mu se posunut.
    
    Jsem hlavne otec, manzel, hrac, fanousek Star Wars, programator a technicky zalozeny ateista ktery 
    veri ze tvrdou praci a cilevedomosti je možné dosáhnout jakehokoliv uspechu.

      V následující části je seznam všech mých projektů, které přežily až
      do dnešního dne. Bohužel, jak už to v naší profesi bývá, jsem z
      technických důvodů ztratil spoustu dat převážně z raného období
      mé práce, nejdřív úplně vše, pak jsem si koupil Synology NAS a 
      zálohoval na více frontách a při druhé ztrátě vše z NASu . Od 
      začátku jsem byl hlavně samoukem a neměl jsem žádné vedení, 
      žádnou pomoc ani nikoho, kdo by mi dal zpětnou vazbu. Sice mi takto 
      vše trvalo déle, ale za to jsem se mohl ponořit i do problematiky, 
      ke které bych se jinak nedostal. V tomto modu operuji 
      již nějaký čas, kdy toto hluboké ponoření do programování
      probíhá až po mé standardní pracovní době. Kdy v zaměstnání
      programuji backend v jiném programovacím jazyce, než ve
      kterém vyvíjím, což je mi dobrou a pestrou zkušeností.`,

      moje děti dělaly to, co já už léta - něco se naučily a pak neměly
      šanci své dovednosti uplatnit). Moje zájmy byly velmi různorodé a
      mimo jiné jsem si konečně zahrál na oficiálním serveru WoW,
      udělal jsem mága na High Level a v rámci Cechu Bohemian Lions
      jsem se „zapsal do historie“. Postavil jsem 3 drony a zúčastnil se
      několika leteckých dnů na letišti v Chebu, jako maršál. Jelikož je
      můj otec celoživotní pilot, k leteckým strojům a technice obecně
      jsem měl vždy velmi blízko. Absolvoval jsem neuvěřitelné
      množství různých kurzů kolem vývoje her, hlavně v Unreal Enginu,
      ale nejen v něm, naučil jsem se programovat v několika
      programovacích jazycích (C++, C#, Java, JavaScript{Myslím si, že
      moc ne HTML a CSS jako programovací jazyky}). Během toho
      všeho se mi narodila druhá dcera a motivace pro pokračování v
      práci je o to větší. A teď si myslím, že konečně nastal ten správný
